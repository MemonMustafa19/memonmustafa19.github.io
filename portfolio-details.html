              <h2>Critical Analysis of WIL Placement</h2>
              <h4>Describe</h4>
              <p>
                During my WIL placement at Australian Community Media (ACM), I was responsible for key tasks that enhanced my technical and transferable skills. These tasks included developing and maintaining Apache Airflow Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to automate data workflows, executing SQL queries in Google BigQuery, and participating in the data migration from Universal Analytics (UA) to Google Analytics 4 (GA4). Additionally, I contributed to the Churn Prediction project and other general bug fixes and feature enhancements, involving data analysis and machine learning.
              </p>
              <p>
                A significant task was the migration of data from UA to GA4, which required creating SQL queries to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data efficiently while ensuring data integrity. Optimizing these queries to handle large datasets exceeding 3 TB was crucial for cost-effective computation. Another important task was the Churn Prediction project, which involved data preparation, feature engineering, and applying machine learning algorithms to develop predictive models for customer churn.
              </p>
              <h4>Interpret</h4>
              <p>
                This placement allowed me to deepen my understanding of data engineering and analytics. Working on the UA to GA4 migration required an in-depth understanding of both the legacy and new analytics systems. Ensuring data integrity during the migration process emphasized the importance of accurate data handling. I developed robust ETL pipelines that processed large volumes of data efficiently, a critical skill in the data analytics industry.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Churn Prediction project provided significant learning opportunities in data engineering. Integrating diverse data sources like subscription data, Google Analytics data, and Braintree transaction data provided comprehensive experience. Developing a baseline machine learning model using XGBoost and experimenting with other algorithms like Random Forest gave me practical insights into model selection and evaluation. This project highlighted the importance of thorough data preparation and feature engineering.
              </p>
              <h4>Evaluate</h4>
              <p>
                Reflecting on my actions, I realize that while I demonstrated strong technical skills, there were areas for improvement. For example, during the initial stages of the UA to GA4 migration, I encountered difficulties in optimizing query performance due to my limited experience with BigQuery. Seeking advice from experienced colleagues and consulting documentation improved my efficiency. This highlighted the importance of proactive learning and seeking help when necessary.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, my time management skills could have been better. Juggling multiple projects sometimes led to tight deadlines and increased stress. In future placements, I plan to implement more effective time management strategies, such as prioritizing tasks based on their impact and deadlines, to ensure a balanced workload.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the other hand, my collaboration skills were a significant strength. Regular meetings with my manager and external teams helped me understand project requirements and deliverables clearly. My adaptability and problem-solving skills were evident when handling unexpected issues, such as resolving data discrepancies for the churn project and fixing a major bug in the conversion click pipeline. These experiences reinforced the value of effective communication and teamwork.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, mandatory cybersecurity training sessions taught me how to protect sensitive data and adhere to industry best practices. This training not only improved my technical knowledge but also heightened my awareness of ethical considerations in data handling.
              </p>
              <h4>Plan</h4>
              <p>
                Moving forward, I plan to build on these experiences by focusing on continuous learning and professional development. I aim to enhance my data optimization skills by taking advanced courses in BigQuery and other data management tools. Additionally, I will improve my project management skills by learning more about agile methodologies and gaining certifications like the Certified ScrumMaster (CSM).
              </p>
              <p>
                To remain adaptable and capable of handling future challenges, I will commit to regular self-assessment and reflection. This involves setting specific, measurable goals for skill development and seeking feedback from peers and mentors. I also plan to stay updated with the latest advancements in data analytics and machine learning by participating in workshops and conferences. Engaging with professional communities through platforms like LinkedIn and attending industry events will help me stay abreast of new trends and network with other professionals.
              </p>

              <h4>Conclusion</h4>
              <p>
                My WIL placement at ACM was a transformative experience that significantly enhanced both my technical and transferable skills. By reflecting critically on my actions and outcomes, I have identified areas for improvement and developed a clear plan for continuous learning and professional growth. This commitment to lifelong learning will not only enhance my employability but also ensure my success in the dynamic field of data analytics and backend development.
