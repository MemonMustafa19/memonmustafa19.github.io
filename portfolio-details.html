              <h2>Critical Analysis of WIL Placement</h2>
              <p>
                During my WIL placement at Australian Community Media (ACM), I worked on several projects aimed at improving customer engagement and subscriber retention. This included developing and maintaining data pipelines, optimizing SQL queries, and implementing machine learning models for churn prediction. A critical reflection on my experience revealed that while I successfully contributed to several key projects, there were areas where I could have improved, such as time management and proactive communication with stakeholders. For instance, the initial stages of the Viafoura data pipeline project faced delays due to a lack of thorough initial planning. By adopting a more structured approach to project management and enhancing my technical skills through continuous learning, I was able to overcome these challenges and deliver effective solutions.

              <h2>Evidence of Technical and Transferable Skills/Knowledge</h2>
              <p>
                My placement at ACM allowed me to develop a range of technical and transferable skills. Technically, I enhanced my proficiency in Python for data analysis and automation, SQL for database management, and BigQuery for handling large datasets. I also gained experience with Apache Airflow for orchestrating data workflows and ensuring data quality. Transferable skills included improved problem-solving abilities, effective communication within a team setting, and strategic planning. A notable example was my contribution to the churn prediction model, where I utilized logistic regression to identify key factors influencing subscriber retention, leading to actionable insights for the company.

              <h2>Evidence of Awareness of Ethical Conduct</h2>
              <p>
                Throughout my placement, I maintained a strong focus on ethical conduct and data privacy. I adhered to ACMâ€™s data handling policies, ensuring that all data processing activities were compliant with relevant regulations. For example, during the development of the Viafoura data pipeline, I implemented encryption and access controls to protect user data. Additionally, I completed cybersecurity training to stay informed about best practices and emerging threats, applying this knowledge to safeguard sensitive information effectively. These efforts underscored my commitment to professional accountability and ethical standards in the ICT industry.
